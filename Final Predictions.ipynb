    "Our model is able to predict housing price with approximately 70% accuracy, which is a significant improvement from our base model. The average mean squared error of a K-fold cross-validation of 30 folds is similar to the MSE values of our train and test sets. Additionally, our model has quite low RMSE values for both our train and our test sets; meaning that on average our model misses our values by \\\\$75,493 for our train set and \\\\$76,147 for our test set. Our test and train set RMSEs are quite close together, so we can assume that our model is not overfit nor underfit, and that our regression does a fair job of estimating our testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our model has made several assumptions. The residuals are normally distributed, features are not correlated with one another and therefore our model has limited multicollinearity, the residuals follow homoscedasticity, and, since we dropped all p-values that are less than 0.05, our remaining features are linearly related."

Therefore, in order to increase the price of the homes in this new developemnt, the housing company should consider including these features in the models of their new builds. "
